             <h3> A sonic map is an interactive map that uses sound as a way to convey qualitative information on a specific location.<br><br>
                No location sounds exactly the same as the next one.<br><br> This website serves as a sort of
                "geo-sonic database" that user can add on to by uploading files (<a href="UploadPageV2.html">you should try it!</a>).<br><br>
                Each soundscape is unique and deserves to be documented.<br><br> While you're here, come <a href = "MapExlporePage.html">listen to the world!</a>
